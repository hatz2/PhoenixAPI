# Phoenix API

This API allows developers to interact with some of the bot functions and exposes a rich client interface to interact with the game without needing to do any reverse engineering by yourself. The goal is to allow developers extend the behaviour of the bot making quick and complex scripts with as little overhead as possible.

## Prerequisites
The API is built upong TCP sockets and JSON so a good understanding of how TCP programming works is key if you want to make your own client. If this is the first time you hear about TCP we recommend you to visit [Socket Programming HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3.13/howto/sockets.html).
Phoenix Premium Membership is required in order to use the API. You can purchase it on the [official website](https://phoenix-bot.xyz/).

## Supported programming languages
Any programming language that supports TCP sockets and JSON will be able to use the API. This includes:
- C# / .NET
- C / C++
- Go
- Java
- Kotlin
- JavaScript / Node.js
- PHP
- Python
- Ruby
- Rust
- Swift
- Lua
- Dart
- R
- Perl+

I recommend you to use Python as the client code is already developed and maintained so it will be easier for you to get started with.

For more information on how to use the API, please refer to the [API Documentation](https://phoenix-13.gitbook.io/phoenix-docs).
